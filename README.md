This workspace contains code for using mixed reality to study GPS waypoint following algorithms on the Clearpath Husky robot. sim_algorithm_x.cpp files should be run with the Unity Robotics simulation and algorithm_x.cpp files should be run on the Husky Robot in an outdoor setting.

----------WARNING-----------DANGER-------------
-----------------------------------------------
Some of the GPS waypoint following algorithms in this repository don't have any obstacle avoidance features. Therefore EXTREME CAUTION must be used when testing these algorithms with a physical Husky robot in a real-world environment. Testing should only be done where the environment is free of people and obstacles and someone must always be ready to intervene and stop the robot in case it goes haywire.
